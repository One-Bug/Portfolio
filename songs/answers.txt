1. Based on the list the average energy: 0.65906, valence: 0.484443 and danceability 0.71646, the "audio aura" of the user should be of a person who likes mild energy and valence song, but its a litle bit more incline for danceable songs. So we may be able to say that any song with this values should be liked for the user.
2. We can't base a person "audio aura" just based on this 3 values, because the human psyche is way more complicated then that, there is plenty of information we are overlooking, like why did the person liked those songs to begin with, or in wich mood he was that year, or the age of the listener, without mention other many facts that may change the "audio aura" of the person, and even with more information, humans are so much deep than that, therefore we may not get a 100% correct result every time.
A better way of calculating the "audio aura" is by creating users profiles (1-2) around the songs they have been listening on the last month and other listeners also were too, this way we can recomend song based on the songs wich the others who has the same kind profile recently liked too or songs with the same kind gender, rythm, beat, or any other of the caracteristics spotify also use to them. But as mentioned before we can not come up with a definitive way of getting the "audio aura" of each individual person a 100% right.
(English is not my first language I hope my ideas were explained correctly and can be understood by others).
